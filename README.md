I wanted to get back into some C coding. I did a lot of recreational C coding in the 1990s. So, I had a look at some of the TDD frameworks but none really met my needs so I decided to have a play. What you see here is the result of a 3-4 hour late night coding session.

The example code in the vectors.c file is just that, soemthing to fiddle with to push forward the implementation of the test framework.

CSPEC is a very barebones TDD framework for C development.

# Place code under test in the ./src directory.

# Write tests in unit/tests

See example

# Run the tests.

> make tests
